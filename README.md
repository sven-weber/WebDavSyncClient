# WebDavSyncClient

A cross-platform client for WebDav Synchronisation written in .net Core. 
The Client supports Mac, Linux and Windows but unfortunately is currently only tested in Linux. 

The plan is to run the synchronisation as a background service in the future. 

### This Project is in alpha state and in active development

Hopefully I will be able to release the first version soon.
